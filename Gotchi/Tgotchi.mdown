My dear pet, "Gotchi" is a rather simple-minded creature.

It needs to be fed, wishes to play and hear your voice from time-to-time.
If you neglect to comply with these timely, it tends to feel unhappy.
A deeply unhappy Tamagotchi escapes, which means you need to restart the game.

Luckily Gotchi likes to sleep long and may even have a nap in daytime.
